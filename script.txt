Scene 1:
In the shadowy confines of "Thy ol' Kernel Keren's Tavern," George Washington reclines amid his rambunctious comrades. The pungent aroma of spilt ale permeates the air, mingling with the dense smoke wafting from hand-rolled tobacco. As the laughter reaches a crescendo, the door bursts open dramatically, and in stumbles Egghead Humpty, gasping out between heaves, "The British have raised our taxes again!"

GW, clenching his fist around a tankard, retorts, "To hell with these tea shenanigans! I'll be damned if me or my kin ever pay tribute to fund some foreign countries wars." 
Murmurs of agreement ripple through the tavern.

The crowd, now on edge, looks to him. "And what's the plan, Washington?" they chorus.

GW stands, striking a pose of defiance. "We pen a rousing declaration, rally the colonies—war for freedom! War to end the occupation! "

Hamilton, ever the firebrand, leaps up, his chair clattering behind. "Hell yes, for our liberty!"

Jefferson, skeptical, chimes in, “This is lunacy, George! Without a solid plan, we're doomed to failure.”

Washington, eyebrows raised in challenge, retorts, “You know what else is doomed? Your marriage prospects after im done with ye”

What follows is a chaotic tangle of flailing limbs and tossed tankards, a comedic brawl between founding figures. As the dust settles, John Adams steps over a fallen chair, his voice cutting through the din, “Enough! I am aware your mother dropped you as child but thats no reason to act like children.”

Washington, dusting off his coat, declares, "The V in Washington stands for victory! For freedom! "

Hamilton, punching the air, adds, “Let’s share some democracy with these red coats!”

The renewed scuffle is a ridiculous spectacle of mismatched duos: Washington and Hamilton versus Jefferson, Madison, and Adams. After a few more moments of comedic wrestling and barbs, they separate, panting and grinning.

Adams, shaking his head concedes, "He might be dysfunctional, but the man's got spirit. Let's atleast see how far he goes."

Jefferson and Madison exchange looks, a mix of resignation and intrigue, then nod. "To revolution, then," Jefferson sighs, stepping forward to join Washington.
