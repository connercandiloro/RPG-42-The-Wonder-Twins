Scene 1: tavern
In the shadowy confines of "Thy ol' Kernel Keren's Tavern," George Washington reclines amid his rambunctious comrades. The pungent aroma of spilt ale permeates the air, mingling with the dense smoke wafting from hand-rolled tobacco. As the laughter reaches a crescendo, the door bursts open dramatically, and in stumbles Egghead Humpty, gasping out between heaves, "The British have raised our taxes again!"

GW, clenching his fist around a tankard, retorts, "To hell with these tea shenanigans! I'll be damned if me or my kin ever pay tribute to fund some foreign countries wars." 
Murmurs of agreement ripple through the tavern.

The crowd, now on edge, looks to him. "And what's the plan, Washington?" they chorus.

GW stands, striking a pose of defiance. "We pen a rousing declaration, rally the colonies—war for freedom! War to end the occupation! "

Hamilton, ever the firebrand, leaps up, his chair clattering behind. "Hell yes, for our liberty!"

Jefferson, skeptical, chimes in, “This is lunacy, George! Without a solid plan, we're doomed to failure.”

Washington, eyebrows raised in challenge, retorts, “You know what else is doomed? Your marriage prospects after im done with ye”

What follows is a chaotic tangle of flailing limbs and tossed tankards, a comedic brawl between founding figures. As the dust settles, John Adams steps over a fallen chair, his voice cutting through the din, “Enough! I am aware your mother dropped you as child but thats no reason to act like children.”

Washington, dusting off his coat, declares, "The V in Washington stands for victory! For freedom! "

Hamilton, punching the air, adds, “Let’s share some democracy with these red coats!”

The renewed scuffle is a ridiculous spectacle of mismatched duos: Washington and Hamilton versus Jefferson, Madison, and Adams. After a few more moments of comedic wrestling and barbs, they separate, panting and grinning.

Adams, shaking his head concedes, "He might be dysfunctional, but the man's got spirit. Let's atleast see how far he goes."

Jefferson and Madison exchange looks, a mix of resignation and intrigue

Jefferson queries with evident skepticism, "Ok, now what?"

GW, brimming with zest, declares, "I want to give King George the American special!"

Jefferson, visibly defeated, turns to Adams, who only manages a helpless glance towards Hamilton.

Hamilton, always one for bold strategies, suggests, "How about we hijack a ship and invade Britain?"

Jefferson starts to object, "That's impossible, sailing from—"

GW interrupts with a fiery glare, "Shut up! 'Impossible' is not in my vocabulary. Men, let us set sail!"

scene 2:harbor

As the scene shifts to the harbor, the air buzzes with anticipation and the scent of salt. Dockworkers scurry about, their shouts mingling with the creaking of ropes and the slap of water against wooden hulls. Amidst the chaos, the towering silhouette of a majestic ship looms large, its sleek form casting an imposing shadow over the bustling dockyard. Guarded by a contingent of stern-faced Redcoats, it seems an impenetrable fortress, a challenge that awaits George Washington and his merry band of rebels.

GW points excitedly, "Hmm, that ship be looking mighty fine, she might be the one."

Adams, exasperated by the day's indecisiveness, snaps, "You've said that about every ship today. Can you please just pick one?"

GW points towards the most imposing vessel guarded by a squadron of Redcoats. "That one," 

Jefferson begins, "Uh, are you sure that one—?"

GW, full of fervor, bellows, "LEROY JENKINS!" and charges headlong towards the ship. Realizing they have no choice but to join in, the rest of the group dashes after him.

As GW and his ragtag band approach, the Redcoats shout, "Surrender!"

GW, rallying his friends, retorts defiantly, "For Democracy for Freedom for Harambe!"

A chaotic fight ensues, with the founding fathers using an improbable mix of improvised tactics and sheer luck.

Post-fight scene

As the dust settles, the Redcoat commander, smirking confidently,taunts "step forward you wigged monkeys".

GW, wiping sweat from his brow, shoots back "No one calls me that except my mother"

Hamilton"Damn right"

Another fight breaks out, equally absurd and yet, against all odds, they prevail once more.

Adams, surveying the aftermath, exclaims in disbelief, "Holy ****, *****   ****  it worked! We're alive!"

Jefferson remains speechless, a blend of relief and disbelief painting his features.

Madison, ever the practical one, suggests, "Let's celebrate. I'll get this party started," and disappears into the ship's hold.

GW, already at the helm, calls out, "No time to rest, To the moon!"

As the ship pulls away from the dock, Adams suddenly realizes, with a jolt of horror, "We left Madison behind!"

The scene closes with the ship sailing into the sunset, the sound of distant waves mixed with the murmurs of a crew both triumphant and incredulous at their newfound fortune.

Scene 3: ocean

As the ship cuts through the ocean waves, propelled by the winds of destiny and the sheer audacity of its crew, the mood aboard is a mix of exhilaration and trepidation. George Washington, at the helm with a makeshift tricorn hat perched jauntily atop his head, surveys the horizon with a determined gaze.

Adam hurries " we forgot Madisson"

gw " Who?"

Adam "MADDISON , our mate"

gw" sure we'll get him a souviner"

Suddenly, a commotion erupts amongst the crew as a monstrous creature  emerges from the depths—an enormous, tentacled creature with a mustache that would rival any dapper gentleman.

"By the crown jewels, it's the Dreadful Davy Squidsworth!" cries out one of the sailors, pointing a trembling finger at the sea beast.

GW, undaunted, takes a swig from his tankard and bellows, "Prepare for battle, lads! We shan't be deterred by a mere oversized calamari!"

Davy " By his majesties 7 wives who are you and why are you on british sea"

Jefferson " we are mere merchants here-"

gw "To kill the king"

Davy " huzaah is that true ? i simply can not  allow it then" 

Davy" i challange you goodsir to a duel"

fight begins

After defeating davy he starts crying

Davy  tearing up and screaming " rahh, i lost my dignity, ahhh"

Adams" There there calm down . its not your fault that you lost its because that wretched king george didnt help you"

Davy " ya! your right it was unfair it was all of you against me"

Adams " so how about we redo the duel again after we speak to the king"

Davy" but wont you kill him"

Adams " no i swear on george washingtons honor and intellect"

Davy" fine ill take you to the king just so we could talk, understood"
